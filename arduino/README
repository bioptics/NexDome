There are two arduino sketches included in this tree, one contains
the sources for the dome rotation contoller, and one contains the
sources for the shutter controller.

Firmware for these controllers was developed using arduino tools
based on Arduino 1.6.5, and makes extensive use of the AccelStepper
library.

The hardware in use is an Arduino Leonardo clone with an xbee socket
already on board.

Refer to the individual firmware files for pin connections.
